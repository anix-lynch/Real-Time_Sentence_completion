## 📝 Intelligent Text Assistant for Predictive Typing and Sentence Completion

In this project, we’re building an **intelligent text assistant** using **Flask** and **Hugging Face** models. The app will help users with predictive typing and sentence completion, using advanced AI techniques to make writing smoother and more efficient. Ready to create a smart text editor? Let’s get started! 🚀💬

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a **Flask-based text editor** that acts as an intelligent text assistant. By using **Hugging Face** models (like GPT-2) for sentence completion and **pyspellchecker** for text correction, the assistant can predict text, offer suggestions, and even fix spelling errors dynamically. The app will feature a **Flask** backend and use **AJAX** to enable real-time text suggestions.

The assistant is designed to enhance user productivity by offering smart suggestions while typing, making it an ideal tool for predictive typing and language processing.

### Key Features:

- 📝 **Predictive Typing**: Suggest text completions and predictions while the user types.
- 🧠 **Text Correction**: Use **pyspellchecker** to correct misspelled words dynamically.
- 🔧 **AJAX for Real-Time Updates**: Create a dynamic text editor with **Flask** and **AJAX** for real-time interactions.
- 🤖 **Hugging Face Models**: Leverage **GPT-2** for generating sentence completions and predictions.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework for building the backend.
- **Python**: Core language for implementing AI models and application logic.
- **Hugging Face Models**: For advanced text prediction and completion features.
- **AJAX**: For creating dynamic and responsive user interactions.
- **pyspellchecker**: For spelling correction functionality.

## 🤖 Skills Applied

- Web Development with Flask
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text Prediction and Correction

## Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Predictive Typing**: Type sentences and receive predictions and suggestions for the next word or sentence completion.
- **Text Correction**: Automatically detect and correct misspelled words while typing.
- **Dynamic Interface**: Use Flask and AJAX to interact with the intelligent text assistant in real time.
